      description: |-
        The duration of the inactivity period in milliseconds.
        The timestamp of the last activity in this call can be calculated with `timestamp - duration`.

        When an inactivity timeout triggers within a potential utterance, we can't yet know whether that utterance
        will result in a successful transcription or if it was likely just background noise. To make sure
        inactivity events aren't sent in the former case, the events are delayed to the end of the utterance.
        As a result, this duration may be longer than the inactivity timeout configured in the project settings.
