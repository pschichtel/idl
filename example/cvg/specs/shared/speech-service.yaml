        If a phrase list is given, transcription results only trigger barge-in if they match one of the phrases.
        A phrase must not contain more than 80 characters, and there must not be more than 100 phrases.

        A phrase "matches" if the transcription result fully contains it. Some notes about matching:
          - matching is case insensitive
          - matching ignores delimiters
          - only whole words are matched
          - phrases can be single words

        This parameter is optional. If specified, it overrides the synthesizer list from the project settings.

        A list of synthesizer vendor names like `"GOOGLE"`. When using custom synthesizer profiles,
        the profile name is attached as a suffix separated by a dash, e.g. `"GOOGLE-profile"`.
        Alternatively, the profile token can be used directly (without the vendor name).

        The first synthesizer in the list has the highest priority. Additional synthesizers
        are used as a fallback (in order) in case a service is currently unreachable.

        The following synthesizer vendors are currently available:

          - `GOOGLE`
          - `MICROSOFT`
          - `IBM`
          - `AMAZON`
